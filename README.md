# Buidl - SocialFi for Creators and Learners
## _A Moralis X Google Cloud Hackathon Project_

Buidl is a Social-Fi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for video content creators (e.g instructors, YouTubers, DIY makers, etc) anyone that shares their skills with other people online either for free or at a particular cost.

Today, there are various existing Web2 solutions for this particular aspect, but we are taking it further leveraging blockchain technology to provide more secured, learning incentives with ownership to the community pattern.

To become a creator on the buidl platform requires a minimum stake of 2000 BDL tokens for a minimum duration of one year, if staking is withdrawn after one year the user is not a creator anymore until they restake a minimum of 2000 BDL back in the contract.
A creator with suspicious activities and a high report rate is subjected to ban and their staked BDL token remains locked in the smart contract, this feature helps us maintain the DAO a safe community.

## Core Features
- # Incentives for learning
    Non creators will cover the largest base of the platform, it is a crucial part of the platform to encourage and reward users to retain them to use and enjoy the       platform.

    At random on every content(free or premium) a user subscribers to on the platform, given that they completed learning from the content a Buidl NFT will be minted       for them at random and based on the content price.

    The Buidl NFT serves as a coupon(discount) on the premium contents, each NFT has a percentage attribute which ranges from 0 ~ 50, this percentage attribute is the     percentage of the nft discount on a premium course.

    The NFT  can be listed in marketplaces like Opensea in exchange for cryptocurrencies to other users.
    
- # Cryptocurrency payment and Guaranteed refund system using Staking protocol
    The Buidl Token (BDL)  is the only payment method of the platform, which will be available on CEX and DEX.

    Cryptocurrency has given us the ability to break international payment barriers and ensures a guaranteed & instant refund policy compared to Web2.0 payments where     it is sometimes complex, slow or impossible to refund back through the gateway the money was charged.

    Whenever a premium content is subscribed to on the platform, the tokens are staked in the smart contract, and released to the creator after two weeks.

    Subscribers can initiate a refund within 2 weeks of subscription and instantly receive back their tokens with a deduction of the sections of the content consumed       already.

    Premium contents will only be allowed to have a minimum content sections of 10, this is very important to keep subscribers as safe as possible.

- # Protection on premium contents
    A better approach to protect videos online is creating custom players to restrict access by other players, this is very common in streaming services like netflix,     etc.

    We have used this approach for the buidl player. It will authenticates users with the wallet and fetch all the contents they have subscribed to on the platform.

    Protecting videos online might not 100% achievable, as it can still be recorded from the device’s screen.

## Revenue Model
- We charge a 8% service fee from every earnings from the creators.
